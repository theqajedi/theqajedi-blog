## QA Origin
![QA](/Quality-Assurance.png)

Most of you are already aware of Q.A. topics from either the industrial practices or the more recent (i'm being 
generous here ðŸ˜¬) adoption in the world of IT. Many of you are probably already using tools and practices to enhance 
the overall quality of software products, may be still not knowing its origin or evolution. So i am going to briefly 
give you an introduction to the actual legends of QA and discuss its significance in SDLC.

Lets go back in time for its origins. There was a time when Japan was known for it poor quality products. 
Surprised? It was not too long ago. Post the WW2 in the 1950's, when the country was still in the control of the 
allied forces. 


Definitioan according to wikipedia: 
_"It is the systematic measurement, comparison with a standard, monitoring of processes and an associated feedback loop that confers error prevention."_
